### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses the Titanic dataset to build machine learning models that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other attributes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques in Python to create and evaluate predictive models.
