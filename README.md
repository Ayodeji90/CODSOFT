##  PROJECTS

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses the Titanic dataset to build machine learning models that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other attributes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques in Python to create and evaluate predictive models.

#### DATA : You can get the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) It contains various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including:PassengerId,Pclass (Passenger Class),Name,Sex,Age,SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard),Parch (Number of Parents/Children Aboard),Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

#### Models
Two Machine Learning models are implemented and evaluated, which include:Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
